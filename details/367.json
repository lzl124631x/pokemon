    "Huntail's tail is shaped like a fish. It uses the tail to attract\nprey, then swallows the prey whole with its large, gaping\nmouth. This Pokémon swims by wiggling its slender body\nlike a snake.",
    "Huntail's presence went unnoticed by people for a long\ntime because it lives at extreme depths in the sea.\nThis Pokémon's eyes can see clearly even in the murky\ndark depths of the ocean."
