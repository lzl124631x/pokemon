    "Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims\neffortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues\npeople from wrecked ships floundering in high seas.",
    "The webbed flippers on its forelegs and hind legs and the\nstreamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed.\nThis Pokémon is definitely much faster than even the most\nathletic swimmer."
